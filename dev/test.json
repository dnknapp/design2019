I strived to make the app as intuitive as possible while allowing users of all levels of design and computer skill to create reports easily. Users can work with presets (templates for page layouts, built-in libraries for colors and font sets) or customize them to better suit their organization. Features targeted specifically to non-profit users include the ability to quickly build tables for financial reporting.\n"
