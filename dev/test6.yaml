        YRLY is a web app, currently under development, designed to help non-profits easily create great-looking online annual reports. I have been responsible for all aspects of design: from branding, to planning the features of a minimum viable product, to designing the user interface.

        YRLYâ€™s concept is simple: a tool for non-profits to publish a single-page website with everything they need to report for the year. I strived to make the app as intuitive as possible while allowing users of all levels of design and computer skill to create reports easily. Users can work with presets (templates for page layouts, built-in libraries for colors and font sets) or customize them to better suit their organization. Features targeted specifically to non-profit users include the ability to quickly build tables for financial reporting.

        One aspect of the interface that I thought could be improved on from other WYSIWYG apps was to clearly show areas where new content containers can be placed. Below is a user flow showing the creation of a new section in a report. (1) Choosing a layout, (2) adding content boxes, and (3-4) filling boxes with content.

        New Hudson Facades is an architectural facade company working on the largest projects in New York. I redesigned and expanded their site for a new sales focus on the company's technology, manufacturing abilities, and services.

        The site's design builds upon New Hudson Facades' branding, maintaining elements from the previous site, including the black and white header photos and color palette, while updating others, like fonts. Polygons that echo the outline of the company's logo add visual excitement and function as section dividers.

        Since we were building the new site concurrently with content being written, a modular system to laying out the pages offered the best design solution. Services, Technology, and Project pages can be built within WordPress out of the appropriate content blocks: introduction, text areas, photos and slideshows, and callouts. Callouts provide users with paths to related projects, news, and other content.
